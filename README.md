## TTR

### Background and Overview

#### **Background**
As a forienger whose first language is not an English, typing quickly and accurately is always my primary concern in order to enhance my code writing speed.  

#### **Overview**
TTR (Type Type Revolution) is a typing game using JavaScript and Canvas API.  
Words will fall from the top and the user has to corretly type each word before they hit the bottom of the screen.  
Word falling speed will increse depending on the level. Some words have special abilities such as decreasing speed, stopping time, or reassembling words.
